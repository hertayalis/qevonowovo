Jacob and Obi Toppin are identical in their abilities to execute stunning dunks while making them appear effortless.</strong></p><p>Obi went on to win National Player of the Year honors and an NBA Draft lottery place as a result of his high-flying, rim-rattling style of play, which is uncommon among collegiate players.</p><p>Jacob has been in college while his elder brother, Obi, has been awarded National Player of the Year and one of the top ten players in the country. The younger brother believes he is on track to compete with his NBA sibling because he began displaying hints of Obi’s mobility as a freshman.</p><h2><span id=Is_Obi_Toppin_related_to_Jacob_Toppin>Is Obi Toppin related to Jacob Toppin?</span></h2><p>Jacob and Obi Toppin are linked because they are brothers. If Kentucky’s Jacob Toppin is on the court, expect the commentators to remember Obi Toppin, the New York Knicks’ big man and former Dayton Flyers great. He’ll never be able to shake his association with the 2020 National Player of the Year, but he’s learning to live with it.</p><p>According to Toppin, their sibling relationship is fraught with rivalry. He claimed that because they were so competitive, they argued while working out in Los Angeles. However, Jacob’s game has altered, and he now believes he is light years ahead of his elder brother. Last year, Toppin averaged 6.2 points and 3.2 rebounds per game while playing more than 18 minutes per game for John Calipari in his second season in Lexington.</p><h2><span id=Jacob_Toppins_Parents_Who_Are_They>Jacob Toppin’s Parents: Who Are They?</span></h2><p>Jacob Toppin was born to Roni and Obadiah Toppin. His father, Obadiah, is the well-known New York City playground character known as Dunker’s Delight. Obi, his elder brother, was the NBA Slam Dunk champion in 2020, a top-10 draft pick, and the unquestioned national player of the year.</p><p>Jacob received comparable raw materials as a blessing. Obi Toppin, a rookie with the New York Knicks at the time, crushed an alley-oop at Madison Square Garden against the Atlanta Hawks last year. Roni could be seen celebrating from the stands as “O-bi” chants rang out throughout the legendary stadium.</p><p>When she was seen bawling over her son’s efforts, it was a lovely moment. Before fans were allowed into the Garden on Christmas Day last year, Roni informed a source that she planned to get a job as a janitor so she could see her son perform live there. Roni Toppin teaches autistic students at a middle school in Washington Heights, according to The New York Post.</p><h2><span id=Jacob_Toppins_Net_Worth>Jacob Toppin’s Net Worth</span></h2><p>According to peopleai.com, Jacob Toppin’s net worth in 2023 is anticipated to be between $2 Million and $4 Million. As a result of his extraordinary development, Toppin has advanced from a career role player to a starter, and possibly a breakout star, for a terrific team with national championship ambitions.</p><p>Jacob’s journey has not been easy, but he has established himself as a serious pro potential. Toppin’s teammates aided his reputation as a great dunker long before he ever played for Kentucky. Toppin’s 360-degree dunk after a steal in the first half of the Jan. 22 game against Auburn could have been the most impressive display of his dunking abilities during the game.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Family Life and Hefty Net Worth Of Bumper Robinson"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/family-life-and-hefty-net-worth-of-bumper-robinson/"}{"1":61}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Family Life and Hefty Net Worth Of Bumper Robinson</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Basketball Player</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Wesley Lowery Parents : Where Are They From | Religion And Siblings</a></h3>American journalist Wesley Lowery has formerly worked for The Washington Post and CBS News.
