Read on to learn more. <span class=credit>NY Post composite/illustration</span></figure><p>Born Dec. 14, 1991, Offset is a Sag sun with an escapist, prefer-to-dwell-in-dreams-than-face-reality Pisces moon. Cardi, born Oct. 11, 1992, is a Libra sun with a hair-on-fire, at-war-with-the-world Aries moon.</p><figure class=wp-block-pullquote readability=2><p>Who wants a basic b—h when you can hitch your wagon to this electric, magically mustached star of stars?</p></figure><p>In one recent <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram live story</a> aimed at Offset, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cardi lamented</a>, “This motherf––ker really liked to play games with me when I’m at my most vulnerable time, when I’m not the most confident, he liked to play games with me, because he knows I’m not an easy girl.”</p><p>And trust, folks, with sun and moon opposition and a grand cross of cardinal planetary chaos in her birth chart, she is not an easy girl.</p><p>But who wants a basic b—h when you can hitch your wagon to this electric, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">magically mustached</a> star of stars?</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Cardi B, a Libra with an Aries moon, symbolizes the energy of this fire/air full moon axis. <span class=credit>Getty Images For Messika</span></figure><p>In terms of sun signs, there’s an instant, effervescent attraction between a charm as a weapon, social savant Libra (Cardi) and a curious, free-wheeling, optimistic Sagittarius (Offset).</p><p>Elementally speaking, <a href=#>air</a> like Cardi can either <a href=#>fuel the fire</a> or blow out the proverbial birthday candles of mutable Sagittarius; I think we see evidence of both in this coupling.</p><p>The infernal nature of Cardi’s Aries moon was likely called to Offset’s dense concentration of mutable fire and, in particular, his bon vivant approach to life and self-expression.</p><p>But that which we are drawn to is not necessarily where we can draw from, and with Cardi’s astro energy ever ready to light the match that burns bond, she might be better served and better balanced by an earth sign or someone with a touch more fixed, enduring energy, than Offset.</p><p>The more you know.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Mercury mystify</h2><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Offset and Cardi B at the MTV Video Music Awards in September 2023. <span class=credit>FilmMagic</span></figure><p>Offset’s Mercury, planet of communication and intellect, is in Sagittarius, while Cardi’s is in Scorpio; this is a clear example of not seeing eye-to-eye or mind-to-mind. Sagittarius is interested in external exploration and personal expansion, while Scorpio is interested in internal investigation/perpetual accusation.</p><p>He’s looking to connect in a light-hearted, rock ‘n’ roll, take it-on-the-run, effusive jokes way — and she’s looking to have unbroken eye contact and talk about sex, shame, death, black holes and anything and everything that’s graying toward shadow territory.</p><p>You can think of their pillow talk as <a href=#>Wednesday Addams</a> or <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Todd from “Wedding Crashers”</a> (Cardi) trying to feel understood by/cerebrally connected to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jesse from “Toy Story.”</a> Lots of blank stares, cold shoulders and shaking heads.</p><figure class=wp-block-pullquote readability=1.5><p>You can think of their pillow talk as Todd from “Wedding Crashers” trying to feel understood by Jesse from “Toy Story”</p></figure><p>Mercury in Scorpio is also highly suspicious, and with Offset’s alleged indiscretions peppering their relationship from the get-go, you can bet Cardi had plenty to drive her to the dark side.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Venus love trap</h2><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Evidence of the Venus in Scorpio connection between Cardi and Offset. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>Both of these crazy kids have Venus, planet of love and attraction, in the basement heart, never-let-go sign of Scorpio. This is the black leather tie that binds and the aspect that explains their on-again, off(set) relationship dynamic.</p><p>Scorpio is the sign of sex and secrets and does nothing lightly — least of all love. Wanting pleasure but feeling more comfortable with pain, this Venus on Venus combination has no chill. It is magnetic, it is hard to quit and it will always, always be a power struggle.</p><figure class=wp-block-pullquote readability=2.5><p>This shared, obsessive, onl- happy-when it-hurts Venus connection suggests these two may not be done torturing one another yet.</p></figure><p>The ancient ruler of Scorpio is Mars, the planet of war. In kind, or not so kind, Venus in Scorpio folk view love as a life or death, kill-or-be-killed scenario. Think always on guard with a deep need for intimacy that is matched in intensity only by a crippling fear of betrayal. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Telltale Cardi lyric</a>: “It’s gon’ hurt me to hate you, but lovin’ you’s worse.”</p><p>With that aspect, both Offset and Cardi are seeking, consciously or subconsciously, transformation through their love relationships, pulling them toward partners that challenge and change but might not meet their essential needs. This shared, obsessive, only-happy-when-it-hurts Venus connection suggests these two may not be done torturing one another just yet.</p><p>Dare to dream.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Mars mismatch</h2><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Cardi B and Offset’s Mars signs are at odds. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>Cardi has Mars, planet of action and aggression, in Cancer, signifying that she puts a lot of energy into family, root systems and security. Mars is weakened in Cancer as the planet of war is unwelcome in the sign of the home front.</p><p>As such, Mars in Cancer folk often struggle with expressing their Martian energy in direct or healthy ways; for further evidence, see the life and times of fellow Mars in Cancer celebrity powder kegs like <a href=#>Teresa Giudice</a>, <a href=#>Chris Brown</a> and <a href=#>Tommy Lee</a>,</p><p>Offset has his Mars in the cowboy-esque, fun-having sign of Sagittarius, suggesting that he puts a lot of energy into having a good time, exploring the fringes, making light and testing his limits. Mars in Cancer takes things hard and to heart, while Mars in Sag lets conflict roll off the back with a smile, a wink, a poorly timed joke and an optimistic, unrealistic promise to be better.</p><p>As you can imagine, these two energies are oft at odds; the water of Cardi’s Mars can put a damper on the easy, breezy, sleazy fire of Offset while his inconsistence, nonchalance and general disregard for hearth, heart and home can boil her proverbial teapot.</p><p>No dice.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Fated for each other?</h2><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Cardi B’s North Node is conjunct with Offset’s sun in Sagittarius. <span class=credit>Getty Images for The Recording A</span></figure><p>Cardi’s North Node, or point of destiny and actualization, is in Sagittarius, Offet’s sun sign — indicating to me that these two were meant to be but not made to last. Offset, as both a partner and a co-parent, was and is an essential part of Cardi’s evolution. Yet, in the book of love, he’s the plot twist but not the prince in shining armor, dig?</p><p>Because we champion love in all its myriad messiness, my hope is that apart or together, at war or in love (same-same but different for Venus in Scorpio), these two find what they’re looking for and find that the best is yet to come.</p><p>Astrologer&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reda Wigle</a>&nbsp;researches and irreverently reports back on planetary configurations and their effect on each zodiac sign.
