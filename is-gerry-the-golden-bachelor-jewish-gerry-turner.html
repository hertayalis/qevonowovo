Gerry is a widower, who lost his wife, Toni, after 43 wonderful years together. They were married in 1974, and had two daughters, Angie and Jenny, and then two granddaughters, Charlee and Payton. Tragically, Toni became ill with a bacterial infection in 2017 and passed away.</p><p><a href=#>On </a><a href=#>The Golden Bachelor</a>, <strong>Gerry has the chance to find the next great love of his life.</strong> He began his journey with 22 women aged 60 and older vying for his heart. Throughout the weeks, he's said some difficult goodbyes at rose ceremonies and when women such as Joan Vassos had to self-eliminate for personal family reasons. Most recently, Gerry eliminated Faith Martin after her hometown date, in one of the most heartbreaking relationship endings in Bachelor Nation history. As Gerry moves into the final part of his Golden Bachelor journey, it's time to find out about his religion.</p><h2 id=gerry-turner-39-s-not-jewish>Gerry Turner's Not Jewish</h2><p>The Golden Bachelor leading man <strong>Gerry is not Jewish, but there has been Jewish representation on the show. </strong>Throughout The Golden Bachelor, neither Gerry nor the women have discussed their religious beliefs with each other, but there were a few hints from some of the women about their faiths. <a href=#>Leslie Fhima wears a Star of David necklace</a>, which is a symbol of the Jewish religion. In addition, Leslie, Ellen Goltzer, Susan Noles, and Theresa Nist did water aerobics while singing "Hava Nagila," which is a Jewish folk song traditionally sung at celebrations such as weddings. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that all of the participating women are Jewish.</p><h2 id=the-golden-bachelor-39-s-gerry-turner-39-s-a-christian>The Golden Bachelor's Gerry Turner's A Christian</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/gerry-turner.jpg><p>The Golden Bachelor's <strong>Gerry is a member of the Christian faith</strong>. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Parade</a>, Gerry shared his Christmas traditions. Christmas is a Christian holiday. He revealed that his family generally celebrates Christmas at his younger daughter Angie's home. Gerry shared that, last year, Angie put up four Christmas trees with many gifts under each of them. He also explained that, because his family members might not see each other as often as they'd like to throughout the year, they make it at least a three-day holiday.</p><h2 id=has-gerry-made-his-choice-on-the-golden-bachelor>Has Gerry Made His Choice On The Golden Bachelor?</h2><p><a href=#>Gerry has narrowed down his group of women</a> to two: <strong>Leslie and Theresa</strong>. He met both of their families on their hometown dates and spent the night in the Fantasy Suite with each of them. Gerry has told both of them that he loves them, a sentiment which was reciprocated by both women.</p><p>It's going to be extremely difficult for Gerry to make his final choice, as he's been seen in previews for the show saying that he took a really good person and broke her heart. He cried that the only time he felt worse in his life was when his wife passed away, and this was a close second. However, hopefully, Gerry will find the happiness that he so deserves and begin his new life with his new love.</p><p><strong>The Golden Bachelor </strong>airs Thursdays at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.</p><p>Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Claire + Emma</a>/Instagram, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Parade</a></p>Related Topics About The Author<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirk6eyprrRmqWtZpOkunC10maenqqirnq1tMRmnqiklJq7bq7AnJ%2BepJ%2Bnequx1qKqoWWXmr%2BzxYytrKumlad8</p></div><div id=links><a href=./kristin-chenoweth.html>&#171;&nbsp;Movies starring Kristin Chenoweth</a>
