Unfortunately, the 24-year-old Canadian actor has officially been charged with murdering his mother. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fox News</a> reports Grantham confessed to shooting his 64-year-old mother, Barbara Waite, in the back of the head. She was reportedly playing piano in her home at the time of the shooting, which took place on March 31, 2020.</p><p id=par-3_67>Grantham pleaded guilty to second-degree murder charges, though the initial charges were murder in the first degree. Two psychiatric reports presented by prosecutors suggested Grantham killed his mother so she wouldn’t witness other violent crimes he intended to commit in the future. He covered his mother’s body with a sheet and placed rosaries and candles by the piano. Grantham’s sister found the body on April 1, 2020.</p><p id=par-4_26>“Mr. Grantham was seeking to save his mother from something he was going to do,” prosecutor Michaela Donnelly explained. “That is something different than altruism.” &nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_24>“Barbara Waite loved her son very much, was an excellent parent, and in her mind had no reason to fear him,” the prosecutor continued.</p><p id=par-6_48>The day after the shooting, Grantham allegedly packed his car with three guns, ammo, 12 Molotov cocktails, and supplies to sustain him while camping. He allegedly planned to kill Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, but he later turned around. Finally, he turned himself in to the police.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-was-ryan-grantham-in-riverdale-what-else-did-he-act-in>Who was Ryan Grantham in ‘Riverdale’?

According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Distractify</a>, he played a character named Jeffrey Augustine in season 4 episode 1, titled “Chapter Fifty-Eight: In Memoriam.” The fandom wiki explains Jeffrey ultimately killed Fred Andrews. Fred was helping a woman on the side of the road change her tire when Grantham’s character hit him with his father’s truck. Fred pushed the woman out of the way of the speeding car, saving her life and losing his own.</p><p id=par-8_60>Riverdale fans know they’ve seen Grantham before, but the actor had roles in other shows and films.
